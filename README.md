This is an implementation of the Vulkan graphics API usign a Rust wrapper called
[Vulkano](https://github.com/vulkano-rs/vulkano). My basic (naive) philosiphy for persuing this
project is:
- I am interested in graphics engines and what makes them "tick"
- Already dabbled in relatively low level game design in PyGame
- Graphics engines scare me beacuse memory safety is something I am not comfortable with
- Rust is memory safe and fast hopefully resulting in a reliable quick graphics engine
